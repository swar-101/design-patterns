# Prototype

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy
existing objects without making your code dependent on their
classes.


## The Problem
Say you have an object, and you want to create an exact copy
of it. How would you do it? First, you have to create a new 
object of the same class. Then you have to go through all the 
fields of the original object and copy their values over to
the new object.
