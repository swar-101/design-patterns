# Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven **solutions to 
recurring design problems in software 
engineering**. They encapsulate best 
practices and provide a reusable template
for solving common design issues. By 
following design patterns, developers
can create robust, flexible, and modular
software systems.

# Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Promotes Reusability:** Design patterns 
promote code reuse by providing standardized
solutions to common problems. Instead of
reinventing the wheel, **developers can
leverage existing patterns to solve similar
problems**.

- **Improves Maintainability:** Design patterns
encourage modular design, making code easier
to understand, modify, and maintain. 
Each pattern addresses a specific aspect of
the software design, leading to cleaner and
more organized code.

- **Facilitates Communication:** Design patterns
serves as a common language for developers
to communicate design decisions and 
architectural concepts. By using familiar
patterns, team members can quickly 
understand and collaborate on software 
projects.

- **Ensures scalability:** Design patterns
help in designing scalable software 
system that can adapt to changing 
requirements and evolving technologies.
By following established patterns, 
developers can build flexible and extensible
architectures.

# Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are categorized into three
main groups based on their purpose:

1. **Creational Patterns:** These patterns focus
on object creation mechanism, providing 
flexibility in creating object while hiding the
creational logic.
2. **Structural Patterns:** Structural patterns
deal with object composition and relationships,
enabling the creation of complex structures
from simpler components.
3. **Behavioral Patterns:** Behavioural patterns
focus on how objects interact and communicate 
with each other, defining algorithms and 
communication patterns.
